# _Crypto Dashboard_

This is my practice project made during studying FastAPI (I wanted to try connecting frontend and backend, learn how does it works??)

Stack:

- Java Script (React)
- HTML
- CSS

Extensions:
- Vite
- Tailwindcss
- Ant Design

## Description
Using a _Vite_ and _tailwind + antd_ I've created simple webpage for connecting to the backend (the main goal of this project). My backend provides actual data, JS grabs them for the website and creates beatiful card and menu on the left with the list of cryptocurrencies. If you want, you can also check the repo of the backend for this poject. [Link](https://github.com/KZN-coder/CryptoDashboard_Backend)
